The goal of this theme is to provide a blogging template for technical bloggers. In addition to the standard requirements for a blog, Technical writers have need for additional features like highlighted code blocks, mathematical notation and interactive code snippets.

With `gatsby-theme-tech-blog-mdx`, all of this functionality is bundled together to allow technical bloggers to get up and running quickly. A default theme was carefully configured to provide readable typography. Optimized image loading is also included as well as support for inline gifs.

## Color Modes

Light and dark modes based on Oceanic and Lighter Material Themes and the default `<Layout>` component includes color mode toggle.
